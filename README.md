# ⚙️ Mini Physics Engine

### Interactive 2D Physics Simulation Engine built in C++ and WebAssembly

A lightweight 2D physics simulation engine developed in **C++** as an Object-Oriented Programming project.

## 🧠 Physics Concepts

The engine implements fundamental concepts used in 2D physics simulation.

### Gravity

Objects experience gravitational acceleration:

```text
F = m × g
```

where:

- `m` = mass
- `g` = gravitational acceleration

### Velocity and Position

Object positions are updated using their velocity and simulation time step.

```text
position = position + velocity × Δt
```

### Forces

Forces modify the velocity of dynamic objects.

```text
a = F / m
```

### Impulse

The engine supports applying impulses to dynamic objects to produce instantaneous changes in velocity.

### Friction

A simplified kinetic-friction model is used to simulate resistance between objects.

### Collision Detection

The engine detects collisions between supported shapes and responds according to the physics model.

# 🏗️ Object-Oriented Programming Concepts

This project was designed specifically to demonstrate important **C++ OOP concepts**.

### Encapsulation

Physics object properties and behaviour are organized within dedicated classes.

### Inheritance

Different object/shape types share common interfaces and behaviour through inheritance.

### Polymorphism

Common interfaces allow different shape/object implementations to be handled through base-class references.

### Abstraction

The physics engine separates simulation logic from individual object and shape implementations.

### Operator Overloading

Custom operators are used for vector and mathematical operations.

For example:

```cpp
Vector2D result = velocity + acceleration;
```

### Exception Handling

Custom exception classes are used to handle invalid simulation operations and errors.

### STL

The project makes use of C++ Standard Template Library components for managing simulation data.

### File Handling

Simulation data and demonstration scenes can be stored and loaded using files.

# 🧩 System Architecture

The project is divided into several logical components.

# 🌐 WebAssembly Integration

The physics calculations are implemented in **C++**.

To make the engine accessible from a web browser, the C++ engine is compiled to **WebAssembly (WASM)** using **Emscripten**.

```text
C++ Physics Engine
        │
        ▼
   Emscripten
        │
        ▼
 WebAssembly (.wasm)
        │
        ▼
 JavaScript API
        │
        ▼
 Browser Interface
```

This allows the browser interface to use the actual C++ physics engine instead of reimplementing the physics calculations in JavaScript.
